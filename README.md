# YoMama
Pythonian Badge Project

yomama.py will tell you a Yo Mama joke when prompted to.
It is a humorous example of how code can be used to make someone laugh.
My project can be used as a refence for other developers to better understand the use of classes and if/else cases.

Run the program in a terminal!
